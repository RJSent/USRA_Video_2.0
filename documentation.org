deactivate T
activate S
S->>T: They are located in $DIR
deactivate S
activate T
loop DetectInFrames

activate D
D->>D: Detects particles with OpenCV
D->>T: Here are the positions of the particles.

end
loop GroupObjects
T->>P: Here are particles in 2 different frames. Pair them together.
activate P
Note over T,P: Pairing means determining out of the list, what pair of points corresponds to 1 particle
P->>T: These are the particles I paired
deactivate P
activate T
T->>T: Store pairings and combine with old
end
T->>V: Returns a list of particles, each containing a series of xy points
